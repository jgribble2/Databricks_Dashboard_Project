# Databricks_Dashboard_Project
Dashboard of US emissions in 2023 created using backend dataset queried with SQL. Inspired by Alex the Analyst's 'Building an End-to-End Data Project in Databricks' video.

Insights drawn from dashboard included the geographical spread of emissions across the country, emissions compared to county population, what percentage each state represents of total emissions, and which counties had the highest amounts of emissions.
